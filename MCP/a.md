# Summary of Live Coding Session: Building a Drum Kit with AI

This document summarizes a live coding session where Wes built a drum kit application using AI and agent mode.

## Core Project
- **Goal:** Build a functional drum kit application that responds to finger movements detected via MediaPipe (AI model)
- **Tools:** Agent mode, MediaPipe finger tracking model, and JavaScript framework (implied but not explicitly stated)
- **Process:** Wes rapidly prototyped and built the drum kit in a live setting, demonstrating agent mode's power for quick development

## Key Accomplishments
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Successfully built a working drum kit in just a couple of hours, showcasing the speed of development possible with agent mode
- **Finger Tracking Integration:** The application accurately detects finger movements and maps them to drum sounds
- **Functional Drum Kit:** The resulting application allows users to "play" drums by moving their fingers

## Challenges & Issues
- **UI Persistence:** The biggest hurdle was keeping UI elements consistently visibleâ€”despite building a complex drum kit relatively easily, ensuring the UI stayed on screen proved surprisingly difficult
- **Context Window/Chat Length:** Concerns were raised about AI performance with longer chat histories, suggesting the AI may "forget" earlier instructions or context (Wes acknowledged this as a potential issue but noted the need for confirmation from AI developers)
- **Technical Glitches:** Both Wes and the host experienced audio and video issues toward the end of the session

## Key Takeaways
- **Agent Mode for Speed:** Agent mode proved to be a powerful tool for rapid prototyping and development
- **AI Simplifies Complex Tasks:** AI models like MediaPipe significantly simplified tasks like gesture recognition
- **UI/UX Can Be Tricky:** Even with powerful AI tools, basic UI/UX issues presented unexpected challenges
- **Context Management is Important:** Maintaining context in long AI conversations remains a potential concern for developers
- **Focus & Planning:** While rapid prototyping is valuable, having a clear plan and focusing on individual components leads to a more polished final product

## Overall
The session demonstrated the potential of AI-assisted development and highlighted both the benefits and challenges of using these new tools. It was a fun and inspiring demonstration of what can be achieved in a relatively short time frame.
