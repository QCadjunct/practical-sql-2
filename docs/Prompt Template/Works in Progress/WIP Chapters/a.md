# Create a comprehensive Markdown guide for Chapter [NUMBER] - [CHAPTER TITLE] Best Practices (PostgreSQL 17)

Please produce a step-by-step guide with detailed explanations in a Markdown document, including the following elements:

1. Create a well-structured table of contents with clickable anchors
2. Include clear section headings with appropriate emoji icons (üìö, üè∑Ô∏è, üîí, etc.)
3. For ALL code examples, provide BOTH snake_case and PascalCase versions:
   - snake_case should use all lowercase with underscores
   - PascalCase should use initial capitals and be enclosed in double quotes to preserve case
   - For constraint naming conventions, use pky instead of pkey and fky instead of fkey
   - Use singular nouns for table names (representing metadata definition)
   - Use fully qualified names with schema prefixes

4. For each section:
   - Provide conceptual explanation with real-world analogies where appropriate
   - Include practical code examples in both naming conventions
   - Emphasize PostgreSQL 17 specific features and improvements
   - Highlight best practices and common pitfalls to avoid

5. Include a comprehensive "Best Practices Summary" section with bullet points
6. End with hands-on exercises that demonstrate the chapter concepts

Important formatting notes:
- Use "Back to TOC" navigation links at the end of each major section
- Ensure proper syntax highlighting for SQL code blocks
- Use meaningful names throughout all examples (avoid cryptic abbreviations)
- Emphasize PostgreSQL 17-specific features (GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, schema organization, etc.)
- Format the title as: "Chapter [NUMBER] [CHAPTER TITLE] Best Practices (PostgreSQL 17)"
