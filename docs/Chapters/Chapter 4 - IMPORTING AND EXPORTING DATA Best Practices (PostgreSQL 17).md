## Introduction

In this chapter, we explore how to handle large volumes of data in PostgreSQL using the `COPY` command. This command facilitates the bulk import and export of data in a structured and efficient manner, avoiding the need for extensive individual insert statements.

## Key Concepts

- **Delimited Text Files**: These files store data in a structured format, where each line corresponds to a table row, and fields are separated by a specific delimiter (commonly a comma or pipe).
- **COPY Command**: PostgreSQLâ€™s native command for importing and exporting data efficiently between tables and external files.

## Working with Delimited Text Files

Delimited text files are a standard format for transferring data between systems. Each row represents a database record, and fields within the row are separated by delimiter characters (commonly commas for CSV files). Handling delimiters, quotes, and header rows correctly is crucial for successful data import and export.

### Quoting Columns that Contain Delimiters

To handle cases where a field contains the delimiter character, such as commas in addresses, text qualifiers (usually double quotes) are used to encapsulate such fields.

### Handling Header Rows

Header rows provide context for the data columns but should be excluded during imports in PostgreSQL using the appropriate options in the `COPY` command.

## Using COPY to Import Data

To import data from a delimited text file into a PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the source CSV file.
2. Create a corresponding table in PostgreSQL.
3. Execute the `COPY` command.

```sql
COPY table_name
FROM 'C:\YourDirectory\your_file.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

This command imports data while specifying the format and whether to include a header row.

## Importing Census Data

A practical example involves importing U.S. Census data from a CSV file. 

1. Create the necessary table structure.
2. Use the `COPY` command to import the census data file.

```sql
COPY us_counties_2010
FROM 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_2010.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

This ensures that all relevant census data is imported into your PostgreSQL table.

## Using COPY to Export Data

Exporting data is similar to importing, but instead, we utilize the `TO` clause to specify the output file path:

### Exporting All Data

```sql
COPY us_counties_2010
TO 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_export.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER '|');
```

### Exporting Particular Columns

To maintain privacy or focus on specific information:

```sql
COPY us_counties_2010 (geo_name, internal_point_lat, internal_point_lon)
TO 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_latlon_export.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

### Exporting Query Results

You can also export results from a query:

```sql
COPY (
    SELECT geo_name, state_us_abbreviation 
    FROM us_counties_2010 
    WHERE geo_name ILIKE '%mill%'
) TO 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_mill_export.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

## Importing and Exporting Through pgAdmin

When working with remote PostgreSQL instances where filesystem access is limited, you can use pgAdmin's built-in import/export wizard. This GUI tool simplifies the process of importing and exporting data from tables without needing direct access to the filesystem.

## Wrapping Up

Understanding how to import and export data effectively allows you to manipulate large datasets efficiently. This chapter has provided practical examples of using PostgreSQL's `COPY` command to handle bulk operations seamlessly.

## Try It Yourself

1. Write a `COPY` statement to handle an imaginary text file with columns formatted as "id:movie:actor".
2. Using the `us_counties_2010` table, export the 20 counties with the most housing units, including only their names and housing unit counts.
3. Consider whether a column defined as `numeric(3,8)` can store values like 17519.668 based on its precision and scale.
