For teaching undergraduates, this comprehensive approach works particularly well as it:

1. **Bridges theory and practice** - Students learn not just what to do, but why it matters in real-world applications

2. **Provides complete working examples** - Students can experiment with code that follows best practices from day one

3. **Introduces modern features** like UUID v7 that may give them an edge in job interviews

4. **Establishes good habits** around naming conventions and schema organization that employers value

5. **Includes ready-made checklists** they can apply to their own projects
