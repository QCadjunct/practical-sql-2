- **Final project presentations**: 2 sessions

## Total Estimated Class Sessions

- **Core content delivery**: 39-47 sessions
- **Assessment and project work**: 7-8 sessions
- **Total estimated sessions**: 46-55 sessions

## Course Format Options

### Standard Semester Format (15 weeks, 2 sessions per week)

- **Total available sessions**: 30
- **Coverage**: Would need to condense material or split into two semester-long courses:
  - PostgreSQL I: Fundamentals through Query Optimization (Chapters 1-5)
  - PostgreSQL II: Advanced Features through Applications (Chapters 6-13)

### Extended Format (15 weeks, 3 sessions per week)

- **Total available sessions**: 45
- **Coverage**: Could cover most material in a single semester with selective focus

### Intensive Course/Bootcamp (8-10 weeks, 5 sessions per week)

- **Total available sessions**: 40-50
- **Coverage**: Could cover most material in an accelerated format

### Year-Long Course (30 weeks, 2 sessions per week)

- **Total available sessions**: 60
- **Coverage**: Complete curriculum with additional time for deeper projects and case studies

## Recommendations

1. **For standard university semester**:
   - Split into two courses (Database I and II)
   - Ensure first course provides complete foundational skills
   - Use second course for advanced/specialized topics

2. **For technical programs with flexibility**:
   - Adopt extended format with 3 sessions per week
   - Integrate laboratory sessions with lecture material
   - Consider summer practicum for capstone projects

3. **For intensive bootcamp settings**:
   - Focus on hands-on applications throughout
   - Assign pre-reading to maximize in-class practice time
   - Organize students into project teams aligned with workplace scenarios

4. **Supplementary approaches**:
   - Develop flipped classroom materials for theoretical concepts
   - Create self-paced modules for installation and setup
   - Establish optional help sessions for challenging topics

This analysis suggests that a comprehensive treatment of PostgreSQL for job readiness would ideally span 45-55 class sessions, making it appropriate for either a two-course sequence in a standard semester system or an intensive single-course format with extended meeting times.
